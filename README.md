To Start Django App Development First we need a setup of Python because Django is a framework of python you can download python here:
https://www.python.org/downloads/ (based of your OS)
After this type this on command prompt
python --version (to check python version in your system)
pip --version (to check pip version)
Now need to install Djago But we do not want the Django set in complete system but for the specific Environment So for this, firstly we need to create the Virtual Environment  for this type in CMD:
pip install virtualenvwrapper-win
makevirtualenv test
